# Project 2 - Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU
Using the chipset that I have built in Project 1, I will now proceed to build a family of adders -- chips designed to add numbers. 

I will then take a big step forward and build an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). 
The ALU, which is designed to perform a whole set of arithmetic and logical operations.

Later in the course I will use this ALU as the centerpiece chip from which I will build the computer's Central Processing Unit (CPU). 

Since all these chips operate on binary numbers (0's and 1's), I started this project with a general overview of binary arithmetic, and only then delved into building the ALU.
