# Project 3 - Memory
Having built the computer's ALU, this Project I turned to build the computer's main memory unit, also known as Random Access Memory (RAM). 
This will be done gradually, going bottom-up from elementary flip-flop gates to one-bit registers to n-bit registers to a family of RAM chips. 
Unlike the computer's processing chips, which are based on combinational logic, the computer's memory logic requires a clock-based sequential logic. 
We started with an overview of this theoretical background, and then moved on to build the memory chipset.
