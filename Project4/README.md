# Project 4 - Machine Language
A critically important aspect of building a new computer system is designing the low-level machine language, or instruction set, with which the computer can be instructed to do various things. 
As it turns out, this can be done before the computer itself is actually built. 
In this project I assumed that the Hack computer and machine language have been built, and wrote some low-level programs using the Hack machine language which is very similar to Assembly . 
I then used a supplied CPU Emulator (a computer program) to test and execute my programs. 
This experience gave me a taste of low-level programming, as well as a solid hands-on overview of the Hack computer platform.
