# Build a Modern Computer from First Principles From Nand to Tetris
In this project-centered course I built a modern computer system, from the ground up. 
I divided this fascinating journey into six hands-on projects: from constructing elementary logic gates all the way through creating a fully functioning general purpose computer. 
In the process, I learned - in the most direct and constructive way - how computers work, and how they are designed.

The course was taught by Professor Shimon Shoken and Professor Noam Nisan.
