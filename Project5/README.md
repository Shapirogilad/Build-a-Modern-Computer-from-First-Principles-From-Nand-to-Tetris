# Project 5 - Computer Architecture
Let's recap the last four Projects: I have built some elementary logic gates (Project 1), and then used them to build an ALU (Project 2) and a RAM (Project 3). 
I then played with low-level programming (Project 4), assuming that the overall computer is actually available. 
In this Project I assembled all these building blocks into a general-purpose 16-bit computer called Hack. 
I started by building the Hack Central Processing Unit (CPU), and then I integrated the CPU with the RAM, creating a full-blown computer system capable of executing programs written in the Hack machine language.
